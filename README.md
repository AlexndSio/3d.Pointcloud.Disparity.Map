# 3dPointcloudDisparityMap
Create a 3d pointcloud from a disparity map

The Block matching algorithmm is used to create a disparity map from the data in the kitti-stereo and also to create a 3d pointclooud from the disparity map.

The same principles apply to the semi global block matching algorithm that I used for a better result.

Also, I have the ground truth projected as a pointcloud.
